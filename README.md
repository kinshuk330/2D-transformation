# 2D-transformation
for transformation(rotation,scaling,translation) of polygon and disc w.r.t origin using matrix multiplication
##How to use:  
Just run this file.  
#### >Enter shape:  
here you can enter either 'polygon' or 'disc'  
If shape entered is polygon  
#### >Enter no. of vertices:  
you can enter as many vertices you want. Just be careful of the order in which you enter coordinates from next line.  
#### >Enter coordinates(x,y):
here you need to enter each coordinates of vertices one by one, like 1 1 (enter) 2 2 (enter) 3 1  
If the shape entered above is disc.  
#### >Enter center coordinates and radius:   
here you need to enter space separated center coordinates and radius.  
after that it will ask for queries.  
Valid Queries are- T,R,S (translation, rotation, scaling)  
For Translation: 'T x y' ( where x and y are movement along x and y axis)  
For Rotation: 'R Q' (where Q is the angle of rotation in degrees)
For scaling: 'S Sx Sy' (where Sx and Sy are respective scaling in x and y direction)  
for exit: 'q' or 'quit'
